# SONOFF TX Ultimate for ESPHome (Custom Component)
This is an ESPHome custom component for the SONOFF TX Ultimate Smart Switch.  
It gives you the ability to use your Switch with ESPHome, including the main features.
Thanks to the on_... actions, you can implement your own functions quickly and easily.  
Flashing via the web installer and then adopting the device in Home Assistant is sufficient to use the pure basic functionalities.

Detected touch events are visualized by short LED signals.  
A short touch on one of the touch surfaces switches the respective relay.
Swipe, long and multi-touch events can be implemented using the on_... actions, for example.
Alternatively, you can also react to swipe and multi-touch via the binary sensors in Home Assistant automations.

# Installation 

&nbsp;  
  
## Minimal code
This is the needed code to use the tx ultimate with this component. 
You can use this as base to implement your own features or leave it as it is and go with the main features (switch relay on touch).  
(Add `_us` to the package name if you want to use the US version of the switch).
```
substitutions:
  name: "shys-tx-ultimate"
  friendly_name: "SHYS TX Ultimate"
  relay_count: "2"

packages:
  smarthomeyourself.tx-ultimate: github://SmartHome-yourself/sonoff-tx-ultimate-for-esphome/tx_ultimate.yaml@main
  
esphome:
  name: ${name}
  name_add_mac_suffix: false

```  
  
&nbsp;  
  
## Local use in ESPHome
You can create your Project yourself without usage of my package by copy the [tx_ultimate_local.yaml](https://github.com/SmartHome-yourself/sonoff-tx-ultimate-for-esphome/blob/main/tx_ultimate_local.yaml) into your project.  
If you want to use the custom component localy, you can copy the [tx_ultimate_touch folder](https://github.com/SmartHome-yourself/sonoff-tx-ultimate-for-esphome/tree/main/components/) into your esphome directory or some subfolder and include it local.
Then you only have to change the source of the external_components entry.

**Example for local custom component**
```
external_components:
  - source: /config/esphome/my_components
    components: [tx_ultimate_touch]
```

## Alternative Blind Control
![image](https://github.com/SmartHome-yourself/sonoff-tx-ultimate-for-esphome/assets/705724/9098ad1d-3a6e-40d8-ad03-d1acfde3cf7a)  
  
If you want to use the switch for blind control, you need a slightly different configuration.  
Especially, the two relays for the motor must be interlocked.  
This setup works only with the 2- and 3-relay version. In both cases, Relays 1 and 2 are used for motor control, as I couldn't configure interlock dynamically.  
For switches with 3 relays, the middle button is assigned to the third relay in the cover configuration. So, you control opening and closing using the left and right buttons.

### Minimal Configuration for Blind Control
The minimal necessary configuration for blinds differs only in the package URL.  
The timings for `cover_open_duration` and `cover_close_duration` should be as accurate as possible. It's better to have a second too much than too little.

```

# Actions
All actions are used to react to touch events and to be able to carry out your own actions on touch/swipe.  
The position where the touch surface was touched is available in all actions via Lambda as touch.x.  
The value in touch.x can be an integer 1 (left) - 10 (right).
  
### on_press
Is triggered as soon as a finger touches the surface.  
  
### on_release
Is triggered, if the finger releases the surface.  
The on_release action only fires, when the release event occurs at the same position as the previous press event and if it's not a multi-touch or long-touch event!  
  
### on_swipe_left
Is triggered, if you swipe from right to left side of the surface.  
  
### on_swipe_right
Is triggered, if you swipe from left to right side of the surface.  
  
### on_full_touch_release
Is triggered, if you touch more than one point on the surface.  
  
### on_long_touch_release
Is triggered, if you touch a point on the surface longer than 5 seconds.  
  
&nbsp;  
  
# Example Code
This is an example of a custom touch action.  
It extends the main functionalities of the Sonoff TX Ultimate switch by adding a custom log output when the touch surface is pressed.  
  
Feel free to customize the actions according to your needs.  

```
tx_ultimate_touch:
  id: tx_touch
  uart: my_uart

  on_press:
    - lambda: >
        ESP_LOGD("tx_ultimate_touch.on_press", "My Event: Position: %d / State: %d", touch.x, touch.state);
```  
  
  
# Components

### relay
Depending on the switch variant, the TX has 1-3 relays installed. Therefore there are 3 switches for the relays.  
According to the documentation, there is also a GPIO for a 4th relay, but I am not aware of any 4-way variant.  

### Touchsurface
The touch surface communicate over uart with the esp. 
It send information for the following events:
- touch press
- touch release
- swipe left (release)
- swipe right (release)
- touch on more than one sensor-point (release)
- long press (5 seconds)
  
### Binary sensors
I've added one binary sensor for each type of touch event, except the long press.  
So you can handle all events easy in Home Assistant.  
The long press event is only usable by using the on_long_touch_release action at the moment.  
  
### LEDs
There are 28 addressable LEDs on board. They are implemented as neopixel platform with 2 predefined effects.

**Effects:**
- Rainbow
- Pulse

### Media player
I've added the media_player component in the package. But currently it is not really usable.
It only produce a lot of noise. I'll update the package if I get it to work propperly.
  
### Vibration motor  
  
## Component IDs
You can use all components based on their ID.  
  
### Binary Sensors
**Touchfield 1:** touchfield_1  
**Touchfield 2:** touchfield_2  
**Touchfield 3:** touchfield_3  
**Swipe left:** swipe_left  
**Swipe right:** swipe_right  
**Multi-touch:** multi_touch  
**Long-touch:** long_press  
  
### Switches
**Relay 1:** relay_1  
**Relay 2:** relay_2  
**Relay 3:** relay_3  
**Vibration motor:** vibra  
**Nightlight** nightlight_active  
  
### Touch Input
**tx_ultimate_touch:** tx_touch  
**uart:** my_uart  
  
### LED Lights
**28 RGBIC LEDs:** leds  
  
### Audio
**media_player:** media_out  
**i2s_audio:** audio_i2s  
  
### Example code to use the components based on their IDs
This is a simple example to turn the LEDs on and off, which are defined in the package. 
*Remember, that this is just an example for ID usage. The on_release is not always triggered. (If you release on another point on the surface as you press). Then the LEDs won't turn off.*
```
  on_press:
    - light.turn_on: leds
	
  on_release:
    - light.turn_off: leds
```
